    <h1>Tyler's Website</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my Website. This is for the HTML Lab assignment but will also of course include a good amount of information about myself aswell.</p>
    <p>This website has a couple of pages, including a page that talks a little more about myself in general, a page incluing some of my past work with art and a few 
    other aspects, a page with a couple of my social media accounts on it, and lastly this page! This page will serve as a small introductory page that will talk 
    about me a little, but will also serve as a directory to the other few pages on this website of mine!</p>
